# CIS7-Project--Doctors-Without-Borders

## Introduction
This case involves the Doctors without Borders. In this scenario, University of California-Riverside has selected 100 graduates to participate in the Doctors without Borders program. Graduates are asked to input their language fluency of either English, Spanish, Russian, or Swahili. They are then asked to input their specialty from Cardiology, Family Medicine, Infectious disease, Neurology, and Pathology. The code randomly chooses five countries that speaks the language that the user inputted. The code then outputs the specialty and country chosen for the graduate. The code will also output the probability of getting a country based off of language fluency.
